In this module I learned insights into OOP principles, class design, error handling, and practical use of Python features for managing personal data and tasks.

The program demonstrates the implementation of a basic diary and task management system using Python classes. Here's what you can learn from this program:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The code is organized into classes (User, Diary_entry, User_Todo, and User_Phone_Book), which helps in structuring and encapsulating related functionalities.
Class and Object Creation: You can see how classes are defined (class ClassName:) and objects of these classes are created with specific attributes and methods.

Attributes and Methods: Learn about class attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on those attributes. 
For example, the Diary_entry class has attributes like title and content, and methods like count_words and reading_time.

Error Handling: The program uses error handling with the ValueError exception to handle cases where reading time estimation is not possible.

Looping and Iteration: The program uses loops to iterate through user information and perform tasks such as collecting past experiences,
finding the best entry for reading time, and gathering incomplete to-do items.

Encapsulation: The principles of encapsulation are applied, with methods within classes serving as the primary means of interacting with class attributes. 
For example, marking a to-do item as complete is done through the mark_complete method.

Code Organization: The code is structured into separate classes, making it modular and easier to understand. Each
class has a specific responsibility, promoting code maintainability and readability.

Functionality Implementation: The program implements various functionalities such as keeping a diary, managing to-do lists, and tracking contacts, 
demonstrating how different classes can interact and provide a comprehensive system.

Understanding Time Calculations: The reading_time method in the Diary_entry class showcases a simple example of time calculations, converting word count to estimated reading time.
