# book_store Model and Repository Classes Design Recipe

## 1. Design and create the Table

Table already made

## 2. Create Test SQL seeds

seed data provided

## 3. Define the class names

Usually, the Model class name will be the capitalised table name (single instead of plural). The same name is then suffixed by `Repository` for the Repository class name.

```python
# Model class
# (in lib/book.py)
class Book


# Repository class
# (in lib/book_repository.py)
class BookRepository

```

## 4. Implement the Model class

Define the attributes of your Model class. You can usually map the table columns to the attributes of the class, including primary and foreign keys.

```python
# Model class
# (in lib/book.py)

class Book:
    def __init__(self):
        self.id = 0
        self.title = ""
        self.author_name = ""
```

*You may choose to test-drive this class, but unless it contains any more logic than the example above, it is probably not needed.*

## 5. Define the Repository Class interface

Your Repository class will need to implement methods for each "read" or "write" operation you'd like to run against the database.

Using comments, define the method signatures (arguments and return value) and what they do - write up the SQL queries that will be used by each method.

```python
# Repository class
# (in lib/book_repository.py)

class BookRepository():

    # Selecting all records
    # No arguments
    def all():
        # Executes the SQL query:
        # SELECT id, title, author_name FROM books;

        # Returns an array of Book objects.

        # Gets a single record by its ID
        # One argument: the id (number)

```

## 6. Write Test Examples

Write Python code that defines the expected behaviour of the Repository class, following your design from the table written in step 5.

These examples will later be encoded as Pytest tests.

```python
# EXAMPLES

# 1
# Get all books

repo = BookRepository()

books = repo.all()

len(books) # =>  5

books[0].id # =>  1
books[0].title # =>  'Nineteen Eighty-Four'
books[0].author_name # =>  'George Orwell'

books[1].id # =>  2
books[1].title # =>  'Mrs Dalloway'
books[1].author_name # =>  'Virginia Woolf'

Encode this example as a test.

## 7. Test-drive and implement the Repository class behaviour
